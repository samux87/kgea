Knowledge Graph Embeddings enrichment with Aneuploidy scores

## Abstract
###Motivation: 
Low-stage lung cancer is known to recur unpredictably, and patients receiving various treatment methods
like radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapies have been seen to respond very differently. Identifying a priori if a
patient is going to relapse or not could make a difference in terms of saving lives and personalized care offered. In this
work, we provide an answer to the following research question: Is it possible to enhance the machine learning (ML) of the
estimated probability of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with aneuploidy imputation
scores?
### Results: 
To predict recurrence in 1,348 early-stage (I-II) NSCLC patients, we train graph ML models utilizing the
Spanish pulmonary cancer group knowledge graph enriched with triples from pathway imputation. ML models trained on
Knowledge graph data enriched with triples from pathway score imputation present an 82% Precision and 91% Specificity
in predicting relapse over 200 patients from a held-out test set. ML models trained using graphs data could prove useful
supplemental tool in the TNM classification systems and improve a lung cancer patientâ€™s prognosis.
